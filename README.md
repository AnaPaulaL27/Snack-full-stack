# Client-Side Project: Snack-full-stack
--------------------------------------------

Project Brief:

In this project your team will be building a front-end application to consolidate the work you have done with JavaScript, React, HTML and CSS. You will have one week to research, plan and develop your application before you have the opportunity to present your work to your colleagues, instructors and clients.

You will be working in different groups from the last project, although in other respects the process will be very similar

For this project you will be building a React application to act as a front-end for one of the APIs built during the server-side projects. Your group will be working with an API none of you have seen before and you will need to familiarise yourselves with it before you start developing your app. The design of your app is up to you, but it must be able to make requests to all of the routes exposed by the API.
